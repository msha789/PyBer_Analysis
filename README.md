There were 1,625 rides in urban cities, 625 rides in suburban cities, and 125 rides in rural cities. Urban cities have the highest demand for rides. Rural cities have the least demand.

There was also a larger volume of drivers in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities. There were 2,405 drivers in urban cities, 490 drivers in suburban cities, and 78 drivers in rural cities. Urban cities have the most drivers. Rural cities have the least number of drivers. Urban cities have 13 times more drivers than rural cities and 4 times more drivers than suburban cities. 

The total fares are consequently higher for urban cities than suburban and rural cities. PyBer transactions in urban cities totaled nearly $40,000 whereas transactions in urban cities and rural cities totaled at least $19,000 and $4,000, each. 

Riders in rural cities pay on average almost $10 more for PyBer than riders in urban cities. The average fare per ride is about $35 in rural cities whereas the average fare per ride is about $25 in urban cities. Suburban cities' average fare per ride falls just in between - at $31. While this is not a good market for the riders in rural cities, it is better for drivers in this type of city. The average fare per driver is about $55 in rural cities, whereas the average fare per driver is about $17 in urban cities. Suburban cities' average fare per driver is about $40.

## Summary

PyBer rides analysis above can help provide a few recommendations to PyBer CEO, listed below: 

- Increasing the number of drivers available for rural cities can help meet the ride demand better. 
- Rural cities might mean longer trips for the drivers operating in these cities and them being occupied for longer times. Including a long-haul option for ride type can help better meet the rural ride demand. 
- Adding a shared-ride can also help better service more of the population’s ride demands. Shared-rides can help reduce the fare for one single passenger and increase the revenue for the overall trip and driver.
